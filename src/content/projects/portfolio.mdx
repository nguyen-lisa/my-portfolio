## Executive Summary
This project focused on designing and developing a personal portfolio website to serve as a central hub for my professional work. The site highlights my UI/UX projects, provides direct access to my resume, and demonstrates my technical capabilities. Accessibility, responsiveness, and usability were prioritized to ensure recruiters, peers, and collaborators could navigate and understand my work with ease. The result is a polished, accessibility-first website that supports professional growth.
